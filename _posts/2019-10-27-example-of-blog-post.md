- **Investigation On The Effect of Hot Forging On The Deformation Behavior And
Microstructural Response of Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing(WAAM) of High**  
Strength Low Alloy(HSLA) Steel Components, Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS).  
**My Contribution:** I established the prototype platform for the digital twin
system of the KUKA welding robot. I also designed the robot multimodal recognition network
and intelligent control algorithm.

- **Development of Digital Twin Prototype: A Visual Digital Twin System For Simulation
and Monitoring**  
Western Digital, Centre of Innovation And Automation Laboratory (CiA lab).  
**My Contribution:** I developed workpiece recognition detection system based on depth camera

- **Research and Application of Rehabilitation Product Styling Design Methods Based on
User Experience and Feature Knowledge Reasoning**  
Key Research Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Henan Province, China(19A460033).  
**My Contribution:** I designed the mechanical structure and hardware control system of the
lower limb rehabilitation exoskeleton. I studied the exoskeletonâ€™s trajectory planning for gait in
the context of rehabilitation medicine.

- **Development of an Intelligent Rehabilitation Training Ladder**  
Intelligent Rehabilitation Equipment Development of Henan Xiangyu Medical Equipment Company Development Project.  
**My Contribution:** I developed the upper computer software for intelligent rehabilitation
equipment
