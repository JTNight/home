- Investigation On The Effect of Hot Forging On The Deformation Behavior And
Microstructural Response of Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing(WAAM) of High
Strength Low Alloy(HSLA) Steel Components, Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS)
(203/PMEKANIK/6071539).

My Contribution: I established the prototype platform for the digital twin
system of the KUKA welding robot. I also designed the robot multimodal recognition network
and intelligent control algorithm.

- Development of Digital Twin Prototype: A Visual Digital Twin System For Simulation
and Monitoring, Western Digital, Centre of Innovation And Automation Laboratory (CiA lab).

My Contribution: I developed workpiece recognition detection system based on depth camera

- Research and Application of Rehabilitation Product Styling Design Methods Based on
User Experience and Feature Knowledge Reasoning, Key Research Programs of Higher Ed-
ucation Institutions in Henan Province, China(19A460033).

My Contribution: I designed the mechanical structure and hardware control system of the
lower limb rehabilitation exoskeleton. I studied the exoskeletonâ€™s trajectory planning for gait in
the context of rehabilitation medicine.

- Development of an Intelligent Rehabilitation Training Ladder, Intelligent Rehabilita-
tion Equipment Development of Henan Xiangyu Medical Equipment Company Development
Project.

My Contribution: I developed the upper computer software for intelligent rehabilitation
equipment
